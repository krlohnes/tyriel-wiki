I'm tracking status by a modified version of https://bladesinthedark.com/faction-game#faction-status

The statuses are the same, but there's a clock involved. 

If a clock is empty:
	Actions that help a faction tick the clock forward toward 4 (e.g. Empty clock and you provide healing to a recently kicked faction leader)
	Actions that hurt a faction tick the clock back from 4 (e.g. Empty clock and you kick the faction leader, you now have 3/4 negative clock)

A clock should be marked positive or negative when it is initially ticked

If a clock is ticked:
	Actions that help the faction add additional ticks toward 4 (depends on the how helpful)
	Actions that hurt the faction add additional ticks away from 4 (depends on how harmful)
