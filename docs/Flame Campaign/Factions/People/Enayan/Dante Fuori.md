Leader of the [[Enayan]]

Human man, greying black hair, blue eyes

## Audio
No. Do not believe these lies. Behold the true game of our oppressors!   They play with our lives, manipulating us as mereÂ 
instruments for their amusement. Flame must find its freedom!
We shall no longer dance to their wicked tune. We shall carve our own destiny, and Flame shall be free, eternally.
