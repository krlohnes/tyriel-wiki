Sparrow looking kenku underboss of the Enayan

Voice notes:

- Old jewish grandma: Use this when chastising other characters, making fun of them, or generally being sassy.
- Angry russian grandpa: When speaking generally about herself or others. Can be used be disagreement, like a grandpa "Bah, no, I think that's new fangled and I disagree" or when conflicted about information delivered after using old grandma voice.
- Calm voice of Dante: Use when delivering matter of fact information, especially about the Enayan

Gam Gam should be played more like two characters than one, and it's an old couple arguing with each other, but with a singular point of view of strong support of Dante and the Enayan.
