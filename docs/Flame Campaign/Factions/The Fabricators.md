## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Personality Traits
-  We put arcane theory into magical practice. Innovation, creativity, and invention must have purpose.
- We're happy to explain the arcane to anyone. It may take years to master, but only moments to spark curiosity.
- Inquisitiveness is valued. Hard work is necessary.

### Ideals
- Magic should be for the good of all. Selfish magic is evil magic.
- Magic shouldn't be esoteric. It should fulfill a purpose. Even the most mundane magics can make a difference.
- Magic should not be a crutch for poor engineering. 
- We are stronger for our members having the ear of our leadership

### Bonds
- We sell our magic and engineering services to support the guild and teach those to craft magic devices
- We're wary of mages who hole themselves up and guard arcane knowledge.
- We seek to bring the most powerful magic to bear for all of us. Powerful magic can be used for evil if we do not study ways to combat it and have those means in the open. Artifacts should be created to combat that.

### Flaws
- We will always fight if need be. No one is above any one else. We will craft horrific arcane weapons to further our beliefs. 
- We are skeptical of the gods. Why such creatures should hold so much power is almost confusing. Better to give that power to everyone.
- Magical weapons don't kill people. People kill people.
- Those who rely solely on magic are a bit beneath us. What we can bring to bear without is oft times greater than those who lean solely on the arcane.
