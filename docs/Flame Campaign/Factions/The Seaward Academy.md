## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Personality Traits
-  We act businesslike and professional when dealing with the wider world. Lessers should not be afforded the same courtesy.
- We push the boundaries of arcane knowledge. Innovation and creativity are a must, but it does not require purpose. Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is an admirable pursuit.
- We do not trust outsiders, and don’t volunteer information that is not requested or required. Non-magical folk rarely grasp arcane matters anyways.

### Ideals

- We rigorously study and carefully teach arcane magic. We value eldritch knowledge, through which we may harness the power of the cosmos itself.
- Mages can accomplish incredible wonders by working together effectively. We are protected and strengthened by our disciplined hierarchy.
- There is no such thing as evil magic, but some mages misuse magic for evil purposes. Unfortunately, those who do not practice the arcane arts rarely grasp such nuance.
- We must protect Vesperium closely as a resource. Its regeneration rate is a matter of current study and until we understand it we must be cautious about over extration, lest Flame fall from the sky.

### Bonds
- We seek to safeguard the most dangerous of arcane secrets from the rest of the world. What some may see as essentially dangerous, we deem the most important to understand
- The suppression of magic through the dams was an egregious act. We will respond, violently if necessary, to any we see as threatening magic in the world.
- We sell our magical services to support and educate the next generation of arcane practitioners. The students of the Academy _must_ be protected as they are the future of magic.
- We're wary of magical tinkerers, though not above using them to aid in our own research.

### Flaws
- Since we are so often misunderstood, we act in unseen and secret ways.
- We are researchers and scholars, not warriors. Risking our talented members is wasteful and reckless when their minds can be put to much better use. Other lives are disposable.
- We believe only Academy mages possess the intelligence and wisdom to wield arcane magic in a responsible way. Magic users who aren’t Academy members are undisciplined amateurs at best, and more often become unhinged criminals.
- Engineered devices are beneath us. A show of arcane, even for the mundane, is how we continue to wield our own in the eyes of others.


### What are they selfish about?

- Vesperium and Arcane knowledge

### What are they selfless about?
- Educating the next generation of arcane practitioners.

### What do they do publicly that others see as good?
- They employ, directly or indirectly, many in Flame. Tinkerers and the Collective owe much of their existence to the patronage of the Seaward Academy.

### What do they do publicly that others see as bad?
- They control all of the mining land that for Vesperium. Many see the mining quotas as far too restrictive and harming the prosperity of Flame. 

### What do they do privately that others see as good?
- They help much of the poor in Flame. The homeless and downtrodden often are taken in by members of the Academy and the Academy tracks these people in order to make sure they are at least comfortable. It isn't necessarily compassion, but making sure even the least of them are comfortable helps maintain control.

### What do they do privately that others see as bad?
- They are agressive about keeping dangerous arcane secrets. Espionage, kidnapping, jailing, and occassionally murder are all means that justify the ends.
