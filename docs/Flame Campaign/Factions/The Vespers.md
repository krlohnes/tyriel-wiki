## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Personality Traits
- We’re willing to lie, cheat, steal, threaten, and even kill to get what we want.
- You can’t trust anyone, but you can trust their greed. Everyone’s got a price.
-  We get even whenever someone crosses us.

### Ideals
- We’re outcasts and outlaws. The laws written by nobles and priests turned us into criminals.
- Anything can be yours if you’re strong enough or smart enough to take it.
- Always stay one step ahead of the game. There’s no heroes here. If you won’t do what it takes to survive, you’re as good as dead.

### Bonds
- We respect the truce made between all outlaws in the Vespers. Anyone else is fair game.
- A favour, a secret, or a good contact can be just as valuable as money to the right person.
- We rule this city from the shadows. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool.

### Flaws
- Take any chance you get to indulge your vices. After all, it might be the last time you get to enjoy it!
- Always look out for yourself. There’s no loyalty amongst thieves. When the chips are down, it’s everyone for themselves.
- Whatever it is, wherever it came from, however we get it, whoever wants it - we don’t care. If someone wants to pay for it, that means money for us!
