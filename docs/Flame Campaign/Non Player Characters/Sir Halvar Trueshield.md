_Human, Male, Paladin of Torm (Oath of Devotion)_

**Appearance:** A tall, broad-shouldered man in his mid-40s, Sir Halvar is grizzled but maintains a dignified presence. His armor is gleaming and carefully maintained, with Torm’s gauntlet symbol emblazoned on the chest plate. A long, jagged scar runs down the right side of his face, a reminder of countless battles.

**Background:** Once a captain in the city guard, Sir Halvar retired to become a wandering knight after the loss of his family during an attack on his home. The trauma of his loss solidified his devotion to Torm, and he dedicated himself to protecting the innocent and enforcing justice wherever he traveled.

**Personality:** Stoic and unwavering in his beliefs, Sir Halvar often struggles with his inability to save everyone. He holds himself to impossibly high standards and expects others to do the same, which can make him seem harsh and inflexible. However, he is deeply compassionate and will never abandon an ally or innocent person in need.

**Quirk:** He carries a simple iron ring that belonged to his late wife, which he twists on his finger when he’s deep in thought.
