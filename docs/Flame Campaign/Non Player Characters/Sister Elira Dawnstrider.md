Half-Elf, Female, Cleric of Torm (Life Domain)

**Appearance:** A serene half-elf with a warm, calming presence, Sister Elira wears simple robes with the holy symbol of Torm embroidered on her sleeves. Her long silver hair is usually pulled back, but a few strands fall around her gentle face, framing her green, compassionate eyes.

**Background:** Raised as an orphan in a temple to Torm, Elira found solace in serving others and became a healer dedicated to mending both physical wounds and spiritual scars. She travels between battlefronts and war-torn villages, bringing hope and relief to those who suffer in the name of Torm.

**Personality:** Patient and kind, Elira embodies the compassionate side of Torm’s teachings. She believes in mercy as much as justice, and will always try to find a peaceful solution before resorting to violence. Her gentle nature masks a fierce dedication to Torm’s cause and a willingness to sacrifice herself for others.

**Quirk:** Elira keeps a journal where she writes letters to those she couldn’t save, which she reads aloud in her nightly prayers to Torm.
