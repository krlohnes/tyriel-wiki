When the lines of power were dammed thousands of years ago by those who wanted to bar monsters from entering the Prime Material, Flame fell to the ocean floor and out of living memory. It lay in its grave until a few centuries ago, when a small group of adventurers broke down the dams and restored the flow of magic, upon which Flame rose like a magnet back into the air and into life.</p> <p>Flame was in ruins when the first new settlers came. Flame lies in the gulf of a continent spanning kingdom known as Cremelia, which, although it had recently survived both civil and interplanar war, wanted to establish its claim as soon as it could. Scholars and archaeologists explored the crumbling city, where marks of religions, rituals, economies, and power that had left the world were everywhere and on everything.</p> <p>They were followed quickly by the mining companies. And the tax collectors. And organized crime.</p> <p>But Cremelia's claim on Flame was questioned by other countries, who didn't want to miss their chance to gain from vesperium, nor to give up the potential and unknown powers it might have.  Flame became the most diverse city in all of Cremelia... for now.</p> <p>Flame is loud, Flame is quiet, Flame is rich (very rich, due to the sale of vesperium), Flame is poor (for the unlucky ones who come out on the bottom). The world is more magical than it had been for millenia as dams were broken and lost history returned. Flame may be more magical than them all. The world recently faced an incursion of Destruction, a forgotten, bound force that was freed by hell and the shadowfell, destroyed millions, and changed entire planes of existence. Creation, Order, and Chaos all rose to have a hand in binding it again, and now people are aware of, and studying, and sometimes worshipping, these four fundamental forces as the world tries to balance itself.</p> <p>Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Corporations. Politicians. Idealists. Anti-monarchists. Loyalists. Foreign agents. Old gods. New gods. Beings who want to be gods. People who want to change the world. People that just want to be left alone. The building is both ancient and stately and shiny and new, as restorationists and developers fight over the ongoing reconstruction.</p> <p>In a physically isolated and highly magical city, some of the standards of sword and sorcery have changed. Airships sail in and out of Flame airspace. Rather than horses and other pack animals, you will see pedal vehicles of all types and conjured creatures pulling very heavy loads or very rich beings. You won't be trekking across wide distances through the jungle, but navigating alleys and riding public transportation and using various tunnels or airways to get from one ward to another.</p> <p>Your character has a reason to get into Flame. They have a reason to not want to work alone all the time. They have long term goals and dreams.</p> <p>It's a new age in the world of Tyriel.</p>"},{"location":"Flame%20Campaign/Flame/#the-government-of-flame","title":"The Government of Flame","text":"<p>The government of Flame is a contentious point at the point we come in, so there will be faction tension here. It is technically under the rule of Cremelia. After the Fall of the Triarchy during the Rise of Destruction, power was consolidated into a single monarch under Fisgrunli Wraithsbane, though some was distributed to a council/cabinet that technically has power to unseat the monarch if they think they are compromised or otherwise unfit. This consolidation of power has been unpopular and some in Flame want independence. Others believe they contribute more than they should to the taxes of the land and hold much of the GDP in their hands so they should be independent since the sale of Flame Campaign/Vesperium is so profitable. There's, of course, others who view this differently.</p> <p>Each of the districts of Flame have an elected councilor and an elected mayor sits at the head of government.

Aeliana was a beloved member of her close-knit community, residing by the sparkling shores of an emerald lake.</p> <p>One fateful evening, bathed in the silvery light of the Feywild moon, Aeliana ventured alone to the tranquil lakeshore. There, she heard a hauntingly beautiful melody that seemed to beckon her, an irresistible call that tugged at the depths of her soul. Driven by a curiosity she couldn't resist, she followed the ethereal song until she reached its source.</p> <p>On the shore lay a magnificent seal, its fur shimmering with an otherworldly, iridescent luminescence. Its eyes held the secrets of the ages, and it sang the same beguiling, mournful tune. Aeliana, her heart filled with compassion and fascination, reached out to touch the enigmatic seal.</p> <p>In that moment, a cruel enchantment, wrought by a covetous archfey, ensnared Aeliana's essence. Her form underwent a transformation, and she became a selkie, her fey beauty concealed beneath a shimmering sealskin. She reveled in the waters, her spirit dancing between exhilaration at her newfound existence and the deep longing for her fey family and homeland, forever out of reach.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to Aeliana, the seal was no ordinary creature but a creation of the covetous archfey, who desired her talents, her beauty, and her voice as their own. The seal spirit bound her to the waters, preventing her from reclaiming her true fey form. Aeliana became the first of the selkies in the Feywild, forever trapped between two worlds, her gifts coveted by the very archfey who had ensnared her.</p> <p>As the years passed, Aeliana's once-joyful songs took on a mournful quality, a reflection of her bittersweet existence. She yearned for the warmth of her fellow fey and the enchanted forests of her homeland. The other fey mourned her absence, singing their own melancholic songs by the emerald lake, hoping that one day, her heart might find solace in their midst. When she finally found her way back to her people, her love, and her family, she felt the same yearning in her heart for the ocean. She could never feel at home.</p> <p>Aeliana's tragic tale became a legend in the Feywild, a poignant reminder of the dangers of desire and the consequences of covetousness. Her haunting songs served as a somber warning to all who dared to explore the enchantments of their mystical realm, where beauty and longing often danced together beneath the silver moonlight.</p>"},{"location":"Flame%20Campaign/Non%20Player%20Characters/Bracius%20Cillimara/","title":"Bracius Cillimara","text":"<p>The Duke of Atrazzo and father of The Don</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Flame%20Campaign/Non%20Player%20Characters/Dark%20Moon%20Heretics/","title":"Dark Moon Heretics","text":"<p>Reese Sonas \u2190 woman who gave sigil thing.</p> <p>Ord Sudana \u2190 guy who disappeared.</p>"},{"location":"Flame%20Campaign/Non%20Player%20Characters/Dr.%20Elira%20Mornshade/","title":"Dr. Elira Mornshade","text":"<p>Dr. Elira Mornshade is a striking drow with deep obsidian skin and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow with an inner light.

They have some enforcers who collect the, of course inflated, port fees. It's a bit lawless, but you better not withhold the port fees. If you want a barge shop, you're paying protection to someone. Other than that, they're happy to look away. For money or favors if you can prove yourself useful. Technically they're under the guard of the city watch and the district councilor, but they too are paid off. There are large portals that can be used to get ships to The Cardinal Canals, but they are prohibitively expensive for all but the largest ships. Most traffic goes through by the foot portals, which they keep a looser leash on, although there is always a close eye on the actual people and very interesting crates might be pushed out of line. The portals are maintained by The Seaward Academy.</p> <p>Flotsam is a fraction of the diameter of Flame hanging above, and rests roughly center below it. Most of the time that means they get fine light, but in the midday a shade passes over it. The edges stay bright with the indirect light around the city, but the centers of Flotsam get shadier and the bustle slows. Locals think of the shade as the chill and nap time of the day, but some locals who don't enjoy bright light become a little more active. At all times, water pours from the Skyward Canals off the side of the city to thunder into the sea around Flotsam. As the wind shifts, spray and mist may be spread across Flotsam but it's far from being hit. During dawn and dusk sometimes the sun shines straight through one of the falls and makes the seedy structures glow gold and pink.</p> <p>Few buildings are actually buildings, most are boats permanently lashed up to the floating platforms.</p> <p>Around Flotsam is a network of lane markers as traffic moves around several floating farms (kelp, shellfish, etc.) and marked-off fishing areas that change over time.</p> <p>Flotsam itself contains:</p> <p>Flotsam Locks, the actual set of 4 portals that pass full size ships up to the Skyward Canals above. They are generally quite large to accommodate large import and export shipments organized by the city government or major organizations. Every once in a while if a much bigger ship needs to enter, a portal can be temporarily expanded, but it strains it and can't be reopened that wide for a while.</p> <p>[[Flotsam Doors]], or \"the doors\" are the pedestrian portals.  Foot traffic, both individuals and small vehicles, passes through 6 open portals, which people and foot and vehicles shunted into different lanes. You must pass through customs to declare imports and exports. You may not import animals into Flame without a permit unless you can prove it is a familiar or other similar being that does not require food or create excrement. Any vehicles that enter are being pulled by hand, magic, or some mechanical means.</p> <p>The Banshee Dash on the Rocks Then Aleling Grandfather Jetsam Square</p> <p>The Blacksmith The Alchemist The Shrines     A few shrines to major gods     A few shrines to lesser known sea gods     One large nondemoninational shrine where you can borrow an enclosed booth for 30 minutes to engage in the worship of your choice</p> <p>One pleasure house A good number of restaurants Shipping supplies shops (rope, tools, etc.) A couple general stores with imported non-ocean foods, regular life general goods, etc. Small school (using magically recorded curriculum) A few shrines to major gods A few shrines to lesser known sea gods One large nondemoninational shrine where you can borrow an enclosed booth for 30 minutes to engage in the worship of your choice A slew of docks for fishing boats and house boats</p>"},{"location":"Flame%20Campaign/Wards/Seaward/","title":"Seaward","text":"<p>Seaward describes the part of Flame that faces toward the sea.
